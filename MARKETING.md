**Title:** I built a free tool that roasts your resume like a brutally honest friend

I got tired of the usual "looks good!" feedback on resumes so I built cvroast.com — paste your CV and an AI gives you a brutally honest score out of 100 with specific roasts about what's wrong.

It's free, takes 10 seconds, and doesn't sugarcoat anything. Most people score between 30-60 (ouch).

If you want, there's a $4.99 option that completely rewrites your CV with ATS-optimized language and real metrics — but the free roast alone is worth trying just to see where you stand.

Would love feedback from this community since you all know what good resumes look like.

### r/GetEmployed — Value Post
**Title:** Free tool to check if your resume would survive an ATS scan

Built this for a friend who kept getting ghosted by applications. Turns out her resume scored 28/100 on ATS readability.

cvroast.com — upload your PDF/DOCX or paste text, get an instant score and 5 specific things wrong with it. Free, no signup, no email required.

The AI is deliberately harsh because polite feedback doesn't help anyone fix their resume.

### r/careerguidance — Comment-Ready Copy
Use when someone posts about not getting callbacks:

"I had a similar issue — turned out my resume was basically invisible to ATS systems. I ran it through cvroast.com (free, instant) and scored 34/100. The AI pointed out I was using vague language like 'responsible for' instead of achievement-focused bullets with metrics. Worth a quick check."

### r/jobs — Value Post
**Title:** Why you're getting ghosted: most resumes score under 50/100 on ATS readability

After seeing dozens of "why won't anyone call me back?" posts, I built a free tool to show people exactly what's wrong.

cvroast.com — paste your resume, get a score out of 100 and 5 brutally honest roasts about what's killing your chances.

No signup. No email. Just honest feedback in 10 seconds.

Common issues it catches:
- Vague bullet points ("responsible for managing things")
- Missing metrics (numbers make you 40% more hirable)
- Wrong keywords for ATS systems
- Generic summaries that could be anyone

### r/cscareerquestions — Tech angle
**Title:** Built a resume roaster in a weekend — it's brutally honest and free

Side project: cvroast.com roasts your resume with AI. Upload PDF or paste text, get a score + 5 specific issues.

Tech stack if anyone cares: Flask + Claude API + Stripe for the optional rewrite. Deployed on Railway.

The scoring is calibrated against ATS parsing — most tech resumes score 40-65 because engineers write "worked on microservices" instead of "Reduced API latency by 40% serving 2M+ daily requests."

### r/recruitinghell — Sympathetic angle
**Title:** I built a tool that tells you what recruiters actually think about your resume (but won't say)

We all know recruiters spend 6 seconds on a resume. cvroast.com tells you what they see in those 6 seconds — and it's usually not pretty.

Free instant roast. No BS. Most people score 30-50.

## TWITTER / X

### Launch Tweet
Your resume probably sucks.

I built cvroast.com to prove it.

Paste your resume → get roasted in 10 seconds with an ATS score out of 100.

Free. Brutal. Honest.

Most people score between 30-60. What's your number? 🔥

### Thread Version
1/ I built a resume roaster and most people's CVs are scoring 30-50 out of 100. Here's why 👇

2/ The #1 problem: vague bullet points. "Responsible for managing team operations" tells a recruiter nothing. ATS systems literally can't parse that.

3/ #2: No metrics. "Improved efficiency" means nothing. "Reduced processing time by 35% saving $12K/month" gets interviews.

4/ #3: Generic professional summaries. If you could swap your name for anyone else's and it still works, it's too generic.

5/ #4: Wrong keywords. Each job posting has specific terms the ATS scans for. If they're not in your resume, you're invisible.

6/ #5: Formatting that breaks ATS parsers. Tables, columns, headers/footers, graphics — they all confuse the robots reading your resume first.

7/ I built cvroast.com to catch all of this instantly. Free, 10 seconds, brutally honest.

Paste your resume and find out your score. Most people are shocked. 🔥

### Personal Post
I built something that most people hate me for.

cvroast.com — paste your resume and get brutally honest AI feedback with a score out of 100.

No sugarcoating. No "looks great!" nonsense. Just the truth about what's killing your applications.

After reviewing hundreds of test resumes, here's what I've learned:

→ The average score is 42/100
→ 90% of people use vague language that ATS systems can't parse
→ Most bullet points describe tasks, not achievements
→ Generic professional summaries are the biggest wasted opportunity

The free roast takes 10 seconds. If you want the AI to completely rewrite your CV with proper ATS keywords and metrics, that's just $4.99 (vs $50+ for a human writer).

Try it: cvroast.com

What did you score? Drop it in the comments 👇

### Short Version
Most resumes score under 50/100 on ATS readability.

Find out yours in 10 seconds: cvroast.com

Free. Brutal. Honest. 🔥

### Maker Comment
Built this in a weekend after watching a friend apply to 80 jobs with a resume that scored 28/100 on ATS readability. She had great experience but her CV was invisible to the robots that screen applications first.

The free roast is genuinely useful on its own. The $4.99 rewrite uses Claude Sonnet to rebuild every bullet point with achievement language and realistic metrics. It's 1% of what a human resume writer charges.

**Post:**
Just found this tool and my resume scored 34/100... I'm shook 😅

cvroast.com — paste your resume and it gives you a brutally honest score with specific feedback on what's wrong. It's free and takes 10 seconds.

Apparently I've been using "responsible for" too much and my bullet points have zero metrics. No wonder I'm getting ghosted by applications.

Has anyone else tried this? What did you score?

## TIKTOK / REELS SCRIPT

**Hook (first 3 seconds):** "Your resume is getting rejected by robots and here's proof"

**Script:**
Your resume is getting rejected before a human even sees it.

I'm going to show you exactly why. [screen record going to cvroast.com]

I paste in a real resume... and [dramatic pause] 34 out of 100.

Here's what the AI said:
[show roast bullets]

The problem? Vague language, no metrics, and keywords that ATS systems can't read.

The fix? You can get it completely rewritten for $4.99. Watch this score go from 34 to 82.

Link in bio. Go check your score — most people are shocked.

## QUORA

Answer questions like "How can I improve my resume?" or "Why am I not getting interview calls?"

**Answer template:**
One thing that helped me was running my resume through an ATS scoring tool. I used cvroast.com (free, instant) and was shocked to score 38/100.

The main issues it flagged:
1. My bullet points described tasks, not achievements
2. I was missing industry-specific keywords that ATS systems scan for
3. My professional summary was too generic

After fixing these issues, my callback rate went from ~5% to about 20%. The tool also offers a $4.99 complete rewrite if you want the AI to do it for you, but even just seeing your score and understanding what's wrong is incredibly valuable.
