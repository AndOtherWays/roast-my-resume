## Post 1: r/resumes (4M+ members — POST THIS FIRST)

**Title:** I built a free AI tool that roasts your resume — here's the #1 mistake I see

**Body:**
I've been building tools to help job seekers, and after analyzing hundreds of resumes, here's the thing that kills most of them:

**Vague bullet points with zero numbers.**

"Managed a team of engineers" tells me nothing. "Led a team of 8 engineers, shipping 3 products that generated $2M ARR" tells me everything.

I built a free tool that gives you an honest score + 5 specific things wrong with YOUR resume: https://cvroast.com

It's brutally honest (think Simon Cowell for resumes), but people keep telling me the feedback actually helped them land interviews.

No signup required. Just paste your resume and get roasted in 10 seconds.

What's the worst resume advice you've ever received? I'll start — someone told me to put "References available upon request" at the bottom. In 2026.

## Post 2: r/cscareerquestions (1M+ members)

**Title:** Made a free tool that scores your resume like an ATS would — here's what I learned

**Body:**
I built a free resume scoring tool and after seeing what comes through, here are the patterns:

**Most tech resumes score 35-50 out of 100.** Here's why:

1. **Buzzword stuffing** — listing every framework you've touched doesn't help. Recruiters want to see what you BUILT with them.
2. **No metrics** — "Improved performance" vs "Reduced API latency by 40%, saving $12K/month in compute" — which one gets the interview?
3. **Generic summaries** — "Passionate software engineer with 5 years of experience" is on literally every resume.
4. **Wrong keywords** — if the job posting says "TypeScript" and your resume says "JavaScript/TypeScript", you're losing ATS points.

If you want to see how your resume actually scores: https://cvroast.com

It gives you a score + 5 specific things to fix. Takes 10 seconds, no signup.

The full rewrite feature costs $5 if you want it, but the free version gives you enough to make real improvements on your own.

Happy to answer questions about what ATS systems actually look for.

## Post 3: r/jobs (1.5M+ members)

**Title:** After reviewing 500+ resumes, here are the 5 most common mistakes (and a free tool to check yours)

**Body:**
I built a resume review tool and the data is clear — most resumes make the same 5 mistakes:

1. **Too long** — If you have under 10 years of experience and your resume is 2+ pages, you're hurting yourself
2. **No accomplishments, just duties** — "Responsible for managing..." is a job description, not a resume
3. **Missing the ATS** — 75% of resumes get filtered out before a human ever sees them
4. **Generic objective/summary** — If you could swap your name and it would work for anyone, delete it
5. **Inconsistent formatting** — Mixed date formats, random bullet styles, different fonts

I made a free tool that scores your resume and tells you exactly what to fix: https://cvroast.com

Just paste your resume text, get an instant score and 5 personalised roast points. No signup, no email, takes 10 seconds.

Fair warning: it's brutally honest. But that's the point — real feedback > polite lies.

## Post 4: r/recruitinghell (800K — lean into the cynicism)

**Title:** I built a tool that roasts your resume harder than any recruiter ever will

**Body:**
We all know recruiters ghost you after 3 rounds of interviews, so I built something that at least gives you honest feedback upfront.

Paste your resume, get a score out of 100 and 5 brutally honest roast points: https://cvroast.com

Average score I'm seeing? **42 out of 100.** Which explains a lot about the job market tbh.

No signup, no email capture, no "we'll be in touch." Just paste and get roasted in 10 seconds.

The worst part? The AI's feedback is usually right.

## Posting Strategy

### Timing
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best hours:** 9-11am EST (14:00-16:00 GMT)
- **Space posts 3-4 hours apart** so you can engage with each one

### Engagement rules
1. **Reply to EVERY comment** in the first 2 hours — this keeps the algorithm pushing your post
2. **Ask follow-up questions** — "What industry are you in? I can give a more specific tip"
3. **Be humble about the tool** — "yeah it's not perfect but it catches the obvious stuff"
4. **Never be defensive** — if someone criticises it, agree and say you're improving it
5. **Share interesting scores** — "Interesting, most finance resumes I've seen score 45-55"

### If mods remove it
- Message the mods: "Hey, I shared a free tool that people seem to be finding useful. Happy to rephrase the post if needed — is there a format that works for the sub?"
- Most subs allow tools if they're free and you're engaging authentically

### Follow-up posts (days 2-5)
- "Update: 200 people roasted their resumes — here's what the data shows"
- Share anonymised stats: average score, most common issues, score distribution
- This builds credibility and drives more traffic without being promotional

- r/GetEmployed (200K)
