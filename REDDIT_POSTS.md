**Title:** I built a free AI tool that roasts your resume — here's the #1 mistake I see

**Body:**
I've been building tools to help job seekers, and after analyzing hundreds of resumes, here's the thing that kills most of them:

**Vague bullet points with zero numbers.**

"Managed a team of engineers" tells me nothing. "Led a team of 8 engineers, shipping 3 products that generated $2M ARR" tells me everything.

I built a free tool that gives you an honest score + 5 specific things wrong with YOUR resume: [LINK]

It's brutally honest (think Simon Cowell for resumes), but people keep telling me the feedback actually helped them land interviews.

No signup required. Just paste your resume and get roasted.

What's the worst resume advice you've ever received? I'll start — someone told me to put "References available upon request" at the bottom. In 2026.

## Post 2: r/cscareerquestions

**Title:** Made a free tool that scores your resume like an ATS would — here's what I learned

**Body:**
I built a free resume scoring tool and after seeing what comes through, here are the patterns:

**Most tech resumes score 35-50 out of 100.** Here's why:

1. **Buzzword stuffing** — listing every framework you've touched doesn't help. Recruiters want to see what you BUILT with them.
2. **No metrics** — "Improved performance" vs "Reduced API latency by 40%, saving $12K/month in compute" — which one gets the interview?
3. **Generic summaries** — "Passionate software engineer with 5 years of experience" is on literally every resume.
4. **Wrong keywords** — if the job posting says "TypeScript" and your resume says "JavaScript/TypeScript", you're losing ATS points.

If you want to see how your resume actually scores, I made this free tool: [LINK]

It gives you a score + 5 specific things to fix. Takes 10 seconds.

The full rewrite feature costs $5 if you want it, but the free version gives you enough to make real improvements.

## Post 3: r/jobs

**Title:** After reviewing 500+ resumes, here are the 5 most common mistakes (and a free tool to check yours)

**Body:**
I built a resume review tool and the data is clear — most resumes make the same mistakes:

1. **Too long** — If you have under 10 years of experience and your resume is 2+ pages, you're hurting yourself
2. **No accomplishments, just duties** — "Responsible for managing..." is a job description, not a resume
3. **Missing the ATS** — 75% of resumes get filtered out before a human sees them
4. **Generic objective/summary** — If you could swap your name and it would work for anyone, delete it
5. **Inconsistent formatting** — Mixed date formats, random bullet styles, different fonts

I made a free tool that scores your resume and tells you exactly what to fix: [LINK]

Just paste your resume text, get an instant score and 5 personalized roast points.

Fair warning: it's brutally honest. But that's the point.

## Posting Tips

1. **Post at peak hours:** 9-11am EST (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday are best)
2. **Engage with every comment** — respond within the first hour
3. **Don't be overly promotional** — lead with value, mention the tool naturally
4. **If mods remove it:** message them, offer to rephrase. Many subs allow tools if presented as helpful
5. **Cross-post timing:** Space posts 2-3 hours apart so you can engage with each
6. **Use your personal account** — tool posts from brand accounts get removed
7. **Upvote strategy:** Share the post with 3-4 friends to get initial traction
